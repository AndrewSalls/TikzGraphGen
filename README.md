# TikzGraphGen
A tool for creating graphs using the Tikz library in LaTeX
A GUI and full editor for creating graph theory diagrams, which are then compilable to actual LaTeX script (using the TikZ library) and directly to PDF.
Because this editor is designed for graph theory, not TikZ in general, not every TikZ functionality is implemented. However, there are some additional features not directly related to graph theory that have been added.

This project is currently in its early stages, so there are many unimplemented functions. I will probably continue to work on this at some point, but for now this project is on pause.
